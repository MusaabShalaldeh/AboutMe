                Hello, my name is Musa'b Shalaldeh, I am a Solo Game Developer, but I am currently a student at ASAC studying Web Development,
                I live in Amman, Jordan, I like to listen to music most of the time as it helps me relax and focus on what I am currently working on, oh and 1 more thing, I hate doing reads.
            </p>
